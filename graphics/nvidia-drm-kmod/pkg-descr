FreeBSD port of Linux's nvidia-drm.ko Kernel module.

nvidia-drm.ko complements the x11/nvidia-driver series of ports. It provides
support for the DRM graphics subsystem, which can then be used by userspace
applications.  This is primarily useful for PRIME render offload and Wayland
compositors.

NVIDIA's 525.⋯ series of drivers was the first with full support for
nvidia-drm.

On FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE and greater: this meta port will automatically install
the port of the recommended version of nvidia-drm.ko.
