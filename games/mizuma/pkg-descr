Mizutamari is a user-friendly front end to Wine. Wine allows various
applications for Windows to be used with alternative operating systems,
such as FreeBSD.

Mizutamari features include:

- installation
- launcher
- uninstallation
- Winetricks
- kill Wine in a selected prefix
- open Mizutamari folder.

To use Mizutamari with KDE Plasma on FreeBSD: 

- you must build games/mizuma to use glxinfo from mesa-demos. 

(The default, glxinfo from glx-utils, indirectly conflicts with ports
such as sysutils/plasma5-kinfocenter and sysutils/plasma6-kinfocenter.)
