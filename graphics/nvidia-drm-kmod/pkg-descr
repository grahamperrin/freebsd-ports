FreeBSD port of Linux's nvidia-drm.ko Kernel module.

nvidia-drm.ko complements the x11/nvidia-driver port. It provides support for
the DRM graphics subsystem, which can then be used by userspace applications.
This is primarily useful for PRIME render offload and Wayland compositors.

NVIDIA's 525.â‹¯ series of drivers was the first with full support for
nvidia-drm.

x11/nvidia-driver was version 535.98_1 when graphics/nvidia-drm-kmod was added
to the FreeBSD ports tree.  x11/nvidia-driver-470 and inferior versions lack
the requisite support.

On FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE and greater: this meta port will automatically install
the port of the recommended version of nvidia-drm.ko.
