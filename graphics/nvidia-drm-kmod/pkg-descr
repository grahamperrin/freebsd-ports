FreeBSD port of Linux's nvidia-drm.ko Kernel module.

graphics/nvidia-drm is an alternative to the x11/nvidia-driver series of ports.

nvidia-drm.ko provides support for the DRM graphics subsystem, which can then
be used by userspace applications.  This is primarily useful for PRIME render
offload and Wayland compositors.

NVIDIA's 525.â‹¯ series of drivers was the first with full support for
nvidia-drm.

On FreeBSD 13.1-RELEASE and greater: this meta port will automatically install
the port of the recommended version of nvidia-drm.ko.
